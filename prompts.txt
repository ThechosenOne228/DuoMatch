Build a modern dating app inspired by Hinge and Tinder—but with a unique twist: it's made for two friends (usually men) to create a joint dating profile, swipe on other duos together, and potentially go on double dates.  🧠 App Concept Summary: Name idea: "DoubleDown", "DuoDate", or "Pair’d"  Users sign up individually but can link up with a friend to form a joint profile.  Swiping and matching is done between pairs (two-on-two).  Both users must approve swipes.  Upon matching, a 4-person group chat is created for real-time conversations.  Inspired by Tinder’s simplicity and Hinge’s profile depth, but tailored to shared experiences and social chemistry.  🧱 Core MVP Features: 1. Authentication Start with email/password signup system (MVP)  Require:  First Name  Date of Birth (Month, Day, Year)  Must be 18+ to register  Future: Add Google, Apple, or Phone number auth with SMS verification.  2. Profile Creation Flow Each user creates an individual profile first.  Photos (min 2)  Bio  Prompts (fun questions like “Our ideal double date is…” or “As a duo, we’re best at…”)  Then, user can invite another person to form a duo:  Invite via link or app search.  Both must approve the joint profile link.  Either can edit the shared bio or images — if enabled in settings.  Consensus system for bio/photo updates: “Request changes” or “Suggest edit” mode.  3. Swiping Mechanism Once linked, duos can swipe on other duo profiles.  Both users must approve a swipe before it gets sent as a like.  Match only occurs if both pairs swipe right.  Optional: Allow real-time chat to decide on likes (e.g., “Do we swipe on this?” chat)  4. Bio Sections “Maybe Me” – for individual flair (personal interests, fun facts).  “Maybe Us” – shared experiences, goals, dynamic.  Both users can collaborate on these, or fill separately.  5. Matching & Chat If two duos match, a 4-person group chat opens up.  Real-time chat with:  Read receipts  Emoji reactions  GIF/sticker support (optional for MVP)  Future: Add voice chat or planned date scheduling.  6. Safety & Privacy Must be 18+  Report/block features  Option to verify profile with a selfie or video prompt  Consent reminders for interactions  7. Optional MVP Bonuses Double date suggestions based on location (restaurants, events)  Profile themes (fun or serious)  Duo compatibility quizzes  🛠️ Tech & Dev Stack Suggestion: Frontend: React Native (mobile-first)  Backend: Node.js with Firebase or Supabase (easy auth and real-time)  Database: PostgreSQL or Firebase Firestore  Auth: Email/password for MVP → add Google, Apple, Phone later  Chat: Firestore real-time or use a plug-in like Stream Chat or Socket.IO  📱 App Flow: Individual Signup ➝ Link Up ➝ Duo Profile ➝ Swipe Together ➝ Match ➝ 4-Person Chat
